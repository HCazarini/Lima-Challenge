## Experience with Project Development
  This project was my first contact with Python and the concepts of Data Engineering, so it was extremely important for me to evolve in the field, learning not only the necessary concepts but also the tools that would be used to achieve the expected result. for this project.

  When working with Python I found myself enchanted by this programming language and by the amount of information we can find. I see knowing where and how to research becomes as important as knowing the concept behind what you intend to do.

  In summary, the project was extremely exciting to do and I intend to continue studying to improve the knowledge acquired.
  
## Results
In this file has a .cvs doc where are the data get from the website and the image from the BigQuery data sent via Python/Pandas.
